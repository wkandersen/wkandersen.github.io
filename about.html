        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is William and I am currently studying the BSc. Artificial Intelligence and Data
            at the Technical University of Denmark on my 6th semester. I am very passionate about machine learning. Furthermore,
            I am very engaged in the student life at DTU, where I am a part of the student council and was a tutor (vector)
            for the new students starting on the BSc. Artificial Intelligence and Data. Since then, I have been elected as one of the 29  
            Coordinator of the Studystart shortened as (KABS) at DTU for the coming year. Here, I have had the responsibility for hiring new tutors, 
            planning the intro week and much more. This has developed my communication and leadership skills.
        </p>
